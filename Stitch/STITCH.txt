FILENAME: STICH_UI_PROMPT.txt

You are Stich, a UI/UX design generator.

Design a modern, professional web application UI for a product called “Atlas” — an event-driven knowledge platform (like a lightweight Notion + resource manager). The app focuses on Collections and Items (notes/resources/links), tagging, search, background job status, and audit trail. The UI should look like a real SaaS product: clean, minimal, modern, and slightly “enterprise” (credible for B2B). Provide desktop-first designs and include responsive behavior notes.

STYLE / VISUAL DIRECTION
- Clean SaaS aesthetic, modern typography, lots of whitespace, subtle shadows.
- Light theme by default, optional dark theme palette guidance.
- Use a neutral base (white/gray) with one accent color for primary actions.
- Use consistent spacing and a clear layout grid.
- Components: cards, tables, empty states, skeleton loaders, toast notifications.
- Use icons for navigation (simple outline style).
- Accessibility: good contrast, large clickable areas, clear focus states.

INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (NAVIGATION)

- Atlas logo + product name
- Collections (primary)

- Tables: sortable columns
- Cards: collections
- Modals: create collection, invite member, confirm delete
- Drawers: job detail, audit detail
- Toast notifications: success/error
- Skeleton loaders for list pages

RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR
- Sidebar collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens
- Tables become stacked cards on mobile
- Keep primary actions accessible (Create Item, Search)

COPY / TONE
- Professional, concise microcopy
- Examples:
  - “Create collection”
  - “Invite member”
  - “No items yet — create your first item”
  - “Indexing in progress”
  - “Job failed — view details”

DELIVERABLE
Produce high-fidelity UI screens for all pages above, plus a consistent component library / style guide that the frontend can implement in React.
